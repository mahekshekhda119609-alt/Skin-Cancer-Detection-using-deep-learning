# Skin-Cancer-Detection-using-deep-learning
Skin cancer detection is vital for early diagnosis and treatment. In this project, a Convolutional Neural Network with EfficientNetB0 is used to classify dermoscopic images. The model captures detailed patterns of skin lesions, offering accurate, efficient, and scalable support for distinguishing between benign and malignant cases.
